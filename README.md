# Live Project
## Introduction
During my Live Project I had the oportunity to work with some amazing people and learn alot from my instructor. Within the 2 week span I managed to spend a lot of time debugging code, cleaning code and adding requested features. The first project I had worked on called Escap-e required me to create a front end layout created with HTMl and styled with CSS. With this specific project, I got a better grasp on how Navbars work and how to position objects better through CSS. With the Cookery Project I contributed to a project that already had progress and had a single area to create using HTML and CSS to show a recipe.
