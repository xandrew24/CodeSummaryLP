# Live Project
## Introduction
During my Live Project I had the oportunity to work with some amazing people and learn alot from my instructor. Within the 2 week span I managed to spend a lot of time debugging code, cleaning code and adding requested features. The first project I had worked on called Escap-e required me to create a front end layout created with HTMl and styled with CSS. With this specific project, I got a better grasp on how Navbars work and how to position objects better through CSS. With the Cookery Project I contributed to a project that already had progress and had a single area to create using HTML and CSS to show a recipe.

## Escap-e
My task here was to replicate a website based off an image of how it looks using Bootstrap 5, HTMl and CSS. I created a navbar and positioned it in the middle and also added a background image as well as its own logo.
html

    <body>
        <div class="container">

## Cookery
While working on cookery I delt with some div containers and how rows and columns work to position the card i was working on for the featured recipe on this webpage. Im thankful for this project because i really learned alot about positioning.
